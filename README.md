# A frontend codebase for the https://www.korukahvila.fi webshop

A fully functioning implementation of the learning project's frontend using React.js, Next.js and Typescript. Backend is running on the Drupal CMS, can be found here: https://github.com/YevKo/webshop-backend. Frontend is hosted on Vercel.

## Learning points

Having a theoretical knowledge of React I decided to start applying it to practice and started from [isolated small projects](https://github.com/YevKo), and a desire to build a real working product has led to a creating of the webshop for my daugther. What I used and learned:

- react.js
- next.js
- typescript
- contextAPI
- i18 internationalization
- MaterialUI
- styled components
- axios
- react forms
- checkout process
- cart state local storage
- order storing in backend
- dynamic rotes
- pagination

## React.js to Next.js

The first MVP implementation of the shop was written in React, using ContextAPI and Typescript.
Then, the code has been refactored for the Next.js v.13.

## UI
The design is taken from the free [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/F2iMQsAjOSBMQtoE7rNkou/E-commerce-Tea-Website-(Community)?type=design&node-id=161-32&mode=design&t=XczGFM7wLoiWsSBY-0) file and adapted for the brand. MaterialUI has been chosen as a frontend framework for learning purposes only. usually I go a no-framework approach with Sass, or Tailwind. Customizing MaterialUI components brough lt of frustration and wasted time :(

## Good to know

this implementation is an MVP product, new features will be added.

- Payments have not been integrated
- No SEO improvements done since wasn't a priority
- Not all accessibility concerns are handled
